[AlgebraicControl.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/AlgebraicControl.jl)

Model predictive control (MPC) is an optimal control technique which involves 
solving a sequence of constrained optimization problems across a given time horizon.
We present a novel Julia library that leverages our theoretical results to automate 
the implementation of correct-by-construction MPC problems in software.
