The GATAS Lab AlgebraicJulia aims to create novel approaches 
to scientific computing based on applied category theory to 
solve computational science and engineering problems. 

We are domain agnostic, working in [dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12282), [physics](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Decapodes.jl), 
[biology](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.2021.0309) and [life sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01445), 
and [industrial engineering applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03820).

The GATAS lab works with Evan Pattersonâ€™s research group at the Topos Institute to develop and maintain the [AlgebraicJulia](https://www.algebraicjulia.org/) software ecosystem.   
Scientists develop simulations by thinking about their scientific concepts, formulating mathematical models,  
and then translating those models into software that answers their questions. 

Our goal is to automate as much of the modeling and simulation process using formalization directly on their scientific concepts. 
Categorical logic gives us the tools to develop custom mathematical tools for each scientific discipline in a coherent framework of useful abstractions. 
By implementing these abstractions in software, we can build more powerful and robust scientific software bespoke to each application, without starting from scratch in each domain.
This conceptual reuse leads to software reuse and acts as a multiplier enabling significant reductions in software engineering effort to develop state of the art scientific codes that can solve complex scientific problems.
