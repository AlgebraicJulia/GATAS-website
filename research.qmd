## Current Projects
### [Decapodes.jl](https://algebraicjulia.github.io/Decapodes.jl/stable/)

Decapodes are a graphical tool for the composition of physical systems.     
Ultimately, this library will include tooling which takes advantage of the formalization of physical theories described by DEC provided by CombinatorialSpaces.jl.


### [AlgebraicControl.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/AlgebraicControl.jl.git)

Model predictive control (MPC) is an optimal control technique which involves 
solving a sequence of constrained optimization problems across a given time horizon.
We present a novel Julia library that leverages our theoretical results to automate 
the implementation of correct-by-construction MPC problems in software.
