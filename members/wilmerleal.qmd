is a postdoctoral researcher at the Computer Science Department at the University of Florida, USA.    

I am fascinated by the interplay between chemistry and mathematics, leveraging mathematical tools to solve chemical questions 
and using chemical intuition to inspire mathematical insights.  
My current research revolves around developing categorical models for various flavours of compositionality in chemistry.
As a chemist, I am naturally inclined to reason and navigate through reaction networks, making hypernetworks a particularly exciting area of study for me.

Prior to joining the University of Florida, I pursued my Ph.D. in the Bioinformatics Group at the University of Leipzig and 
the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, Germany.  
There, I explored both mathematical structures and vast chemical databases. This enabled me to delve into the depths of chemical space, 
uncovering its secrets and unraveling the intricate history of chemistry.

Ultimately, my goal is to advance our understanding of the rich interplay between chemistry, mathematics, computer science and history of science.
