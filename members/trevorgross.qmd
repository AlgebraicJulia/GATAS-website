is an undergraduate junior studying computer science affiliated with the Florida Institute for National Security Talent Pipeline.

My research interests lie in developing and implementing new techniques to solve existing problems. I primarily work in the AlgebraicOptimization.jl library to improve the efficiency of distributed systems and make other engineers' work easier. I am a highly motivated student who aims to contribute to research and industries worldwide.
