is a master's student with a focus in numerical linear algebra and high-performance computing.

I believe that advances in the field of computer science are dependent on the existence of a highly 
performant computational foundation. It is critical that this foundation considers the theoretical
aspects of algorithms, the method by which they are implemented in code and how they interact with the
physical designs of modern processing and memory units.

I am also a developer on the [Decapodes.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Decapodes.jl) and
[CombinatorialSpaces.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/CombinatorialSpaces.jl) projects.
