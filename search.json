    "text": "The GATAS Lab AlgebraicJulia aims to create novel approaches to scientific computing based on applied category theory to solve computational science and engineering problems.\nWe are domain agnostic, working in dynamics, physics, biology and life sciences, and industrial engineering applications.\nThe GATAS lab works with Evan Patterson’s research group at the Topos Institute to develop and maintain the AlgebraicJulia software ecosystem.\nScientists develop simulations by thinking about their scientific concepts, formulating mathematical models,\nand then translating those models into software that answers their questions.\nOur goal is to automate as much of the modeling and simulation process using formalization directly on their scientific concepts. Categorical logic gives us the tools to develop custom mathematical tools for each scientific discipline in a coherent framework of useful abstractions. By implementing these abstractions in software, we can build more powerful and robust scientific software bespoke to each application, without starting from scratch in each domain. This conceptual reuse leads to software reuse and acts as a multiplier enabling significant reductions in software engineering effort to develop state of the art scientific codes that can solve complex scientific problems."

As a chemist, I am naturally inclined to reason and navigate through reaction networks, making hypernetworks a particularly exciting area of study for me.\nPrior to joining the University of Florida, I pursued my Ph.D. in the Bioinformatics Group at the University of Leipzig and the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, Germany.\nThere, I explored both mathematical structures and vast chemical databases. This enabled me to delve into the depths of chemical space, uncovering its secrets and unraveling the intricate history of chemistry.\nUltimately, my goal is to advance our understanding of the rich interplay between chemistry, mathematics, computer science and history of science."

The main focus of my work is the emergence of complexity and how this relates to the mathematics of Compositionality (the philosophical contention that the structure or meaning of the whole depends on that of its parts).\nIn this context, the stories I am interested in are often set in the land of computational complexity where combinatorial explosion guides and motivates deep insights in graph structure theory, parameterized complexity theory and finite model theory. I use category theory to better understand how the profound tools developed in the above areas relate to each other and to understand how far they can be pushed and generalized."
