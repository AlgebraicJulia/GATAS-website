As a chemist, I am naturally inclined to reason and navigate through reaction networks, making hypernetworks a particularly exciting area of study for me.\nPrior to joining the University of Florida, I pursued my Ph.D.¬†in the Bioinformatics Group at the University of Leipzig and the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, Germany.\nThere, I explored both mathematical structures and vast chemical databases. This enabled me to delve into the depths of chemical space, uncovering its secrets and unraveling the intricate history of chemistry.\nUltimately, my goal is to advance our understanding of the rich interplay between chemistry, mathematics, computer science and history of science."

    "text": "is leading development on the CombinatorialSpaces.jl and Decapodes.jl projects.\n‚Ä¶ for representing multiphysics models and automatically generating simulations from those representations.\n\nI am interested in problems that applied scientists face when they do any computational work. In particular, I mean the problems of developing models faster, and making the models themselves faster and more accurate. I lead a couple of projects on this front: Decapodes.jl and CombinatorialSpaces.jl.\nWe use techniques from Applied Category Theory (ACT) to represent models (as ‚ÄúDecapodes‚Äù) and how models compose together. These models are systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). ACT - the ‚Äúscience of composition‚Äù - lets us analyze scientific models as mathematical objects in their own right. Catlab.jl - an ACT programming library - enables us to write a library in an ACT-programming style, without sacrificing performance. We use Catlab‚Äôs implementation of ‚ÄúC-Sets‚Äù by specifying a small Decapode ‚Äúschema‚Äù, which produces an efficient in-memory database to store a model. Doing algebra on these models then becomes as efficient as performing database operations. It is quite natural to interpret a system of PDEs as a relational database, adopting the point of view that such systems describe how physical quantities relate to one another.\nOf course, when we generate simulations from these Decapodes, we need a framework for understanding numerical methods. Otherwise, we only have an encyclopaedia or ontology of physics equations, and nothing to ‚Äúdo‚Äù with them. The Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC) is a good fit here, since it generalizes vector calculus, and differential operators become efficient matrix-vector operations that we can chain together. The DEC works on any type of manifold - a representation of space that makes sense, like a sphere, a plane, or a teapot - and so a Decapode is not necessarily tied to any particular shape or resolution of space. In 1 dimension, your physics make sense on a line or a circle. The CombinatorialSpaces.jl library is where we have implemented a representation of such spaces as ‚Äúsimplicial sets‚Äù, and definitions of differential operators.\nDeveloping a library for scientific computing is best done by collaborating with the user that you have in mind. So I lead a few collaborations with labs who study space weather. One model simulates electron dissipation - where electrons end up in our atmosphere as they precipitate down from space - and another is a model for galactic cosmic ray (GCR) and solar energetic particle (SEP) transport - how particles coming from other stars or the Sun travel through our solar system. There are applications for the weather on Earth as well, from modeling glacier dynamics to the circulation of matter in our atmosphere."

The main focus of my work is the emergence of complexity and how this relates to the mathematics of Compositionality (the philosophical contention that the structure or meaning of the whole depends on that of its parts).\nIn this context, the stories I am interested in are often set in the land of computational complexity where combinatorial explosion guides and motivates deep insights in graph structure theory, parameterized complexity theory and finite model theory. I use category theory to better understand how the profound tools developed in the above areas relate to each other and to understand how far they can be pushed and generalized."
