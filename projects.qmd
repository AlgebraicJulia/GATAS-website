## Software

### Decapodes.jl

![Decapodes Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlgebraicJulia/Decapodes.jl/main/docs/src/logo/decapodes_logo.svg)

[Decapodes.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Decapodes.jl) are a graphical tool for the composition of physical systems.     
This library includes tooling which takes advantage of the formalization of physical theories described by DEC provided by CombinatorialSpaces.jl.

### Dynamics, Optimization and Control

[AlgebraicControl.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/AlgebraicControl.jl)

Model predictive control (MPC) is an optimal control technique which involves 
solving a sequence of constrained optimization problems across a given time horizon.
We present a novel Julia library that leverages our theoretical results to automate 
the implementation of correct-by-construction MPC problems in software.
