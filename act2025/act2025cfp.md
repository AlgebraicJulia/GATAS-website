## Call for participation

The [Eighth International Conference on Applied Category Theory](https://gataslab.org/act2025) will take place at the University of Florida on June 2-6, 2025\. The conference will be preceded by the Adjoint School on May 26-30, 2025\. This conference follows previous events at Oxford (2024, 2019), University of Maryland (2023), Strathclyde (2022), Cambridge (2021), MIT (2020), and Leiden (2019).

Applied category theory is important to a growing community of researchers who study computer science, logic, engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, social science, systems, linguistics and other subjects using category-theoretic tools. The background and experience of our members is as varied as the systems being studied. The goal of the Applied Category Theory conference series is to bring researchers together, strengthen the applied category theory community, disseminate the latest results, and facilitate further development of the field.


## Important dates

All deadlines are AoE (Anywhere on Earth).

* February 26: Title and brief abstract submission  
* March 3: Paper submission  
* April 7: Notification of authors  
* May 19: Pre-proceedings ready versions  
* June 2-6: Conference

## Submissions

The submission URL is: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=act2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=act2025) 

We accept submissions in English of original research papers, talks about work accepted/submitted/published elsewhere, and demonstrations of relevant software. Accepted original research papers will be published in a proceedings volume. The conference will include an industry showcase event and community meeting. We particularly encourage people from underrepresented groups to submit their work and the organizers are committed to non-discrimination, equity, and inclusion.

* Conference Papers should present original, high-quality work in the style of a computer science conference paper (up to 12 pages, not counting the bibliography; more detailed parts of proofs may be included in an appendix for the convenience of the reviewers). Such submissions should not be an abridged version of an existing journal article although pre-submission arXiv preprints are permitted. These submissions will be adjudicated for both a talk and publication in the conference proceedings.

* Talk proposals not to be published in the proceedings, e.g. about work accepted/submitted/published elsewhere, should be submitted as abstracts, one or two pages long. Authors are encouraged to include links to any full versions of their papers, preprints or manuscripts. The purpose of the abstract is to provide a basis for determining the topics and quality of the anticipated presentation.

* Software demonstration proposals should also be submitted as abstracts, one or two pages. The purpose of the abstract is to provide the program committee with enough information to assess the content of the demonstration.

The selected conference papers will be published in a volume of Proceedings. Authors are advised to use EPTCS style; files are available at [style.eptcs.org](https://style.eptcs.org).

Reviewing will be single-blind, and we are not making public the reviews, reviewer names, the discussions nor the list of under-review submissions. This is the same as previous instances of ACT.

In order to give our reviewers enough time to bid on submissions, we ask for a title and brief abstract of your submission by February 26\. The full two-page pdf extended abstract submissions and up to 12 page proceedings submissions are both due by the submissions deadline of March 3 11:59pm AoE (Anywhere on Earth).

Please contact the Programme Committee Chairs for more information: Amar Hadzihasanovic ([amar.hadzihasanovic@taltech.ee](mailto:amar@ioc.ee)) and JS Lemay ([js.lemay@mq.edu.au](mailto:js.lemay@mq.edu.au)).
