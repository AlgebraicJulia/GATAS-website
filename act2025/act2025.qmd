### Conference Info

This year, lunch and coffee will be provided for attendees. This will understandably mean that there will now be registration fees. We are using a tiered system based on occupation category:

- Students \$140
- Academics \$300
- Industry professionals \$700

Travel and registration assistance will be available to students depending on final registration numbers and funds available. Please follow this link for [assistance applications](https://forms.gle/MWDdBqNdFM9EewXv7).

Due to technological constraints, only the keynote addresses, and the community meeting will be accessible via Zoom. Recordings of presentations will be made available after the conference on a best-effort basis. For exceptional circumstances in which a presenter cannot attend in person, submissions may be published in conference proceedings alone, and/or a recorded presentation may be made available after the conference. If circumstances outside your control prohibit you from presenting your work in person, please contact conference organizers.

### Adjoint School

More information about the adjoint school can be found at [adjointschool.com](https://adjointschool.com/2025.html).

### LGBTQ+ Statement

The 2025 conference for Applied Category Theory will be held at the University of
Florida in Gainesville, Florida. As organizers, we understand that the current political climate
and legal policies of the state of Florida do not instill a sense of comfort and safety in individuals
from marginalized communities, especially the LGBTQ+ community. However, the organizers,
University, and local community are committed to creating a welcoming environment for all.
Along with the ACT community, Gainesville, FL is a kind and welcoming place for
individuals of all backgrounds and experiences. Organizers and attendees of ACT 2025 will not
tolerate any abuse or discrimination, direct or indirect, against members of the LGBTQ+
community. This event will be an opportunity to learn from each other, build connections and
collaborations, and discuss our research and pedagogy in applied category theory. We welcome
all members of the ACT community to participate in this endeavor, regardless of gender,
sexuality, race, religion, etc.

### Inclusive Spaces Resources

Organizers can confirm that most buildings on campus, including the one the conference activities take place in, have multiple accessible, single-occupancy restrooms.
