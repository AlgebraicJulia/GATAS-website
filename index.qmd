title: "GATAS Lab"
---

The GATAS laboratory uses applied category to develop novel approaches to scientific
computing. We are domain-agnostic, solving problems in
[dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12282),
[physics](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Decapodes.jl),
[biology](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.2021.0309),
[life sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01445),
and [industrial engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03820). The laboratory works closely
with Evan Patterson's research group at the [Topos Institute](https://topos.institute) to
maintain and develop the [AlgebraicJulia](https://www.algebraicjulia.org/) software ecosystem.
