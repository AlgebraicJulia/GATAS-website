## Applied Category Theory 2025

The GATAS Lab is hosting the 8th International Conference on Applied Category Theory here at UF.

The GATAS laboratory uses applied category theory to develop novel approaches to scientific
computing. We are domain-agnostic, solving problems in
[dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12282),
[physics](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Decapodes.jl),
[biology](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.2021.0309),
[the life sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01445),
and [industrial engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03820). Our group works closely
with Evan Patterson's research group at the [Topos Institute](https://topos.institute) to
maintain and develop the [AlgebraicJulia](https://www.algebraicjulia.org/) software ecosystem.

## Philosophy

Scientists develop simulations by translating scientific concepts into mathematical models,
and then embodying those models in software. We seek to automate this process using
[category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory).
Category theory is a mathematical language rich enough in abstraction to represent any
scientific concept, yet pliable enough to manipulate efficiently with a computer. The
software in [AlgebraicJulia](https://www.algebraicjulia.org/) encodes a number of these
abstractions; with it, scientists can build powerful, robust, and bespoke scientific models
without starting from scratch in each domain.
