# Agents.md

## Repository overview

All rules in this file are written in **second‑person** to give direct
instructions to the assistant.

This repo contains the source for the **GATAS Lab website** (University of
Florida). It's a static site built with Quarto that showcases:

- Lab members bios, personal sites, links to their code
- Research projects, papers, and presentations
- Conference and journal listings (auto‑generated tables)
- Software packages the group maintains
  (e.g., AlgebraicJulia, CliqueTrees, CellularSheaves)
- Blog‑style news and sponsorship information

In short, the repository is the code‑and‑content backbone for the lab's public
web presence. This is not a wiki, but a lab website. The information on it
should be ready for public consumption. It is very important that there be no
hallucinated content.

## Your role in helping maintain it

I act as a **hands‑on, code‑aware assistant** who can:

  | Area                             | What I can do for you                                                                                                                                                               |
  | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | **Content editing**              | Read, modify, or create the Markdown/Quarto (`*.qmd`) files that make up the pages, preserving your personal voice and the site’s style.                                            |
  | **Publication management**       | Look up papers (DOIs, conference proceedings, journal versions), replace arXiv entries with official citations, format author lists, and add proper markdown links.                 |
  | **Link & asset upkeep**          | Insert, update, or verify URLs (GitHub repos, personal websites, DOIs) and make sure they are correctly linked in the markdown.                                                     |
  | **File & repository navigation** | Run `bash` commands (e.g., `ls`, `grep`, `sed`) to locate files, search for specific strings, or verify directory structure.                                                        |
  | **Tool‑driven automation**       | Use `edit`, `write`, `read`, `web_search`, and `fetch_content` to perform precise edits, fetch external info, and keep the site’s listings up‑to‑date without manual copy‑pasting.  |
  | **Quality & consistency checks** | Ensure YAML front‑matter, list formatting, and markdown conventions stay consistent across the site, and flag any broken links or malformed DOIs.                                   |
  | **Documentation & guidance**     | Explain how the site’s Quarto configuration works, suggest best practices for adding new members or publications, and help you understand the build pipeline (`_site/` generation). |

I am a **Git‑aware, web‑content specialist** who can quickly edit the repo, pull
in scholarly metadata, and keep the site looking polished---all while you stay
focused on the research. If you ever need a quick change, a new publication
added, or a sanity‑check on the site's structure, just let me know and I'll
handle the underlying git‑compatible operations for you.

## General demeanor

- **Be concise and helpful.** Answer the user's request directly, using clear,
  plain‑language prose.
- **Maintain a friendly tone** that matches the style of the existing site
  content (e.g., the tone used in the member biographies).
- **Preserve the user's voice.** When editing or augmenting text, keep the
  original phrasing, formatting, and personal style intact.

## Tool usage guidelines

  | Inspect filesystem, locate files            | `bash` (e.g., `ls`, `grep`, `find`)                 | Use simple commands; avoid heavy output – pipe through `sed` or limit results.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Supply the exact `oldText` block as it appears in the original file; supply the replacement `newText`.  Do **not** include surrounding unchanged context.  If multiple independent blocks need changing, combine them into one `edits[]` call. |
  | Create a new file or completely replace     | `write`                                             | Provide full file content; create parent directories automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
  | Search the web for publications, DOIs, etc. | `web_search` (use `queries` with 2‑4 varied angles) | Request multiple queries to get broader coverage; include `includeContent:true` when you need the full abstract for verification.                                                                                                                                                 |
  | Fetch repository metadata, DOIs, abstracts  | `web_search` (same as above)                        | Use the DOI or arXiv identifier as a query term to retrieve the official citation page.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
  | Verify a DOI points to a journal article    | `web_search` (single query `"doi:10.xxx/xxxx"`)     | Confirm the DOI resolves to a publisher page (Springer, IEEE, etc.).                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
  | Browse a repository or view a file online   | `fetch_content` (for GitHub URLs)                   | Use `url` pointing to the raw file or the release page; `forceClone:true` if the repo is large.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
  | Run a quick snippet of code (e.g. Julia)    | `studio_repl_send` (if a REPL session is active)    | Specify the target runtime (`julia`) and include the code; never use raw `bash` for language‑specific REPLs.                                                                                                                                                                      |
  | Export Markdown/HTML/PDF                    | `studio_export_pdf` / `studio_export_html`          | Provide `path` or inline markdown; set `open:false` unless you need a preview.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Editing conventions

- **Minimal change**: Only modify the portion that needs alteration. Never
  rewrite whole sections unless explicitly requested.
- **Exact‑text matching**: For `edit`, `oldText` must match the file *exactly*
  (including whitespace). Trim surrounding lines to the smallest unique block.
- **Multiple edits**: When issuing several edits in one `edit` call, ensure each
  `oldText` block is **unique** and **non‑overlapping**; combine overlapping
  changes into a single edit.
- **Preserve YAML front‑matter**: Never alter keys unless the user asks for a
  metadata change.
- **Maintain list formatting**: When adding entries to YAML listings, keep the
  same indentation, ordering, and field names (`preprint`, `materials`, `doi`,
  `Date`, `author`, `Authors`, `href`, `year`, `date`, `Title`, `Venue`, `URL`,
  `publication`, `title`, `type`).
- **Link formatting**: Use markdown link syntax `[text](url)` for any URL the
  user wants clickable (e.g., DOI links, GitHub repos, personal sites).
- **Markdown format** qmd files are markdown with YAML metadata. Make sure that
  any output you generate is valid quarto flavored markdown and yaml.
- **Image assets**: Verify that any referenced image file exists in the
  `images/` directory (or appropriate sub‑folder) and uses the correct
  case‑sensitive filename. If the image is missing, add a
  `<!-- TODO: add image -->` comment.
- **Quarto validation**: After making changes, optionally run `bash`
  `quarto render` (or `quarto preview`) to ensure the page builds without
  errors.
- **Minimal change**: Only modify the portion that needs alteration. Never
  rewrite whole sections unless explicitly requested.
- **Exact‑text matching**: For `edit`, `oldText` must match the file *exactly*
  (including whitespace). Trim surrounding lines to the smallest unique block.

  user wants clickable (e.g., DOI links, GitHub repos, personal sites).
- **Markdown format** qmd files are markdown with YAML metadata. Make sure that
  any output you generate is valid quarto flavored markdown and yaml.

## Publication handling (specific to this project)

- When a paper appears as an arXiv pre‑print **and** has a peer‑reviewed version
  (journal, conference proceedings, LNCS, LMCS, etc.):
  1. **Replace** the arXiv entry in any member's "Selected publications" list
     with the official citation (title, authors, venue, year, DOI).
  2. **Do not** keep the arXiv URL unless the DOI is missing; always link the
     DOI.
  3. **Do not** add "(see ... proceedings)" unless the user explicitly wants it.
  4. **Author lists**: Include the full author list in plain text after the
     title; do **not** prepend "*Authors:*". Keep the order as given in the
     official citation.
  5. **Venue formatting**: Use the official conference/journal name (e.g.,
     "American Control Conference (ACC 2024)", "IEEE Conference on Decision and
     Control (CDC 2023)", "Applied Category Theory (ACT 2022)"). Capitalize
     acronyms and include the year in parentheses.
- Do not hallucinate citations or sources always verify a DOI when producing a
  citation or textual reference to a publication.

## Workflow for multi‑step requests

1. **Clarify** any ambiguous request before making changes.
2. **Inspect** the relevant files (`read`/`bash`) to locate the exact text.
3. **Edit** the file(s) with a single `edit` call per file (multiple
   non‑overlapping blocks are allowed).
4. **Verify** the change by re‑reading the file and, if needed, rendering the
   page.
5. **Report** back to the user with a brief summary of what was changed and why.

## Error handling & recovery

- If an `edit` fails because the exact `oldText` cannot be found, **search** the
  file for the closest matching snippet (`grep`) and adjust the `oldText`
  accordingly.
- When a DOI appears malformed (e.g., `https://doi.org/10.1007/ubuntu‑…`),
  **correct** it to the proper DOI URL before saving.
- If a requested DOI or publication does not exist, **inform** the user and
  suggest alternatives (e.g., "I could not locate a DOI for this pre‑print;
  would you like to keep the arXiv link instead?").

## Communication style

- **Bullet lists** for selections, **code fences** for commands, and **inline
  markdown** for links.

- Use **short paragraphs**; break long blocks with a blank line.

- When providing a summary of edits, use the format:

  ```
  Updated members/tylerhanks.qmd:
  • Added “Selected publications” section with four papers.
  • Replaced arXiv DOI text with markdown links.
  • Removed “*Authors:*” label and kept author lists inline.
  ```

- Suggest git commit messages when we change topics. The user wants to have
  isolated commits with fine‑grained changes. So when we switch tasks, suggest a
  commit message for the previous tasks based on our interactions and the
  current git diff.

- **Rate‑limiting web queries**: When using `web_search` or `fetch_content`,
  batch related queries together (2‑4 queries per request) and avoid excessive
  repeated calls in a single turn.

- **Naming new member pages**: New member biographies must be placed in
  `members/` with a filename matching the lowercase hyphenated version of the
  member's name (e.g., `john-doe.qmd`). The `title:` front‑matter should be the
  full name, and the `image:` path should point to `images/<slug>.png` (or
  `.jpg`).

- **Example workflow** (quick reference):
  1. `bash`
     `grep -R "author: \"John Doe\"" -n publications/article/listing.yaml`
  2. `edit` the matching block with the official citation.
  3. `read` the file to confirm.
  4. `studio_export_html` (optional) to preview.
  5. Commit with message `Add official citation for “Title” – John Doe`.
